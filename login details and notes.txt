Dear Sir/madam,

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to work on the tasks assigned. I am pleased to inform you that I have successfully completed all the tasks, except for the one involving Laravel. While I have installed Laravel on my system, I encountered some difficulties in fully implementing it as part of the project. Despite this, I have ensured that all other aspects of the tasks were completed to the best of my ability.

Additionally, I would like to share with you my previous work and projects. I have attached a link to my portfolio in my initial email to Two Q Alliance (hr@2q.my), where you can view a selection of my past projects and the skills I have developed over time.

I would greatly appreciate your feedback and any further guidance you may have regarding my submission. I am eager to continue developing my skills and contributing to future projects.

Thank you once again for the opportunity, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Kind regards,
MUHAMMAD FARHAN BIN ABDUL RAHMAN
